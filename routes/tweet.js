/* In update(), we are updating a single tweet's contents.
 *
 * Like with show(), we pass the query paramers into the Tweet() object.
 *
 * Note our parameters in save(). The first parameter is an object of key-values
 * that we want to update in the DB. For simplicity, we're just going to pass 
 * our whole object in. Ideally, we'd ditch the id first so the DB's id value 
 * never changes.
 *
 * The second parameter in save() is {patch: true}, which just tells Bookshelf 
 * to update only those fields we passed in the first argument.
 *
 * We haven't done much error handling so far (except for show()). then() is 
 * part of Javascript Promises ("thenables"). It actually includes 3 callback 
 * functions (we've only used one to date). The first returns a model or 
 * collection in the event of a successful operation.
 *
 * The second callback occurs when an error has been thrown. We've added a 404 
 * error here in this case (I'm assumming) it means the tweet doesn't exist at 
 * the ID, although we could perform additional checks to see if it's a 
 * validation issue.
 * 
 * Also, although we don't use it here, the error callback also passes back
 * an object with more error details in it.
 * 
 * The third callback (not implemented here) occurs when there is progress to 
 * report.
 *
 * In case you were wondering, this is also how you'd handle errors with the 
 * create() method we did earlier.
